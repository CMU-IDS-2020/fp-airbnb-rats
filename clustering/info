kmeans: A distance based clustering algorithm that partitions the dataset into 'K' groups based on the distance between the points.

PCA: A deterministic, linear dimensionality reduction technique.

t-SNE: A probabalistic, non-linear dimensionality reduction technique.

hierarchical clustering: Builds a hierarchy of clusters based on a distance metric.

Linkage: Linkage is important because it is the criterion that determines which type of distance should be used in building the hierarchy.
