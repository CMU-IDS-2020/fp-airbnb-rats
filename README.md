# Setting up

`npm i` and `npm start` from the `/reactd3` and you should see a dashboard at `localhost:3000`

No need to worry about the npm audit vulnerabilities - they're all related to react-scripts, which is just a dev dependency and shouldn't change the production build.

# Special thanks

@emeeks on github for his [repository](https://github.com/emeeks/d3_in_action_2) with starter code.
